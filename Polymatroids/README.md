# Polymatroids

This directory contains a rudimentary `Polymatroids` package which
can be used to compute facets and extreme rays of the polyhedral cone
of polymatroids on a finite ground set.

A *polymatroid* on ground set `N` is a function from the powerset of
`N` to the reals which evaluates to zero on the empty set and is
submodular. A polymatroid is the rank function of a matroid of it
is integral and bounded by the cardinality function.

The data generated by the script [`H4.jl`](H4.jl) is a human-readable
text file [`H4.log`](H4.log) containing the dimension, facets and extreme
rays of the 4-polymatroid cone. Extreme rays which are matroids are
tagged in the output.
