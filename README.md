# Research Data in Discrete Mathematics â€” Worksheet

* [Likelihood degenerations](https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/LikelihoodDegenerations/ML_degrees_of_matroids.html) (Example 4.1): What is the ML degree of the Pappus matroid?

* [No eleventh conditional Ingleton inequality](https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/ConditionalIngleton/index.html) (Section 3.1): Find the 6814 shortest masks of the Ingleton expression.

* Package the SAT solver [`Kissat`](https://github.com/arminbiere/kissat) (with proof support) for Julia: see [Creating Packages](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/creating-packages/) and [Artifacts](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/artifacts/).

* Take the research data in [this repository](Polymatroids/) and reproduce it on a freshly installed OS (container) of your choice. Can you automate this procedure?
